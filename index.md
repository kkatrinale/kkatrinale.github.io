### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite because it was my first time ever coding. I was almost like a culture shock because I had never seen codes before. It was pretty intimidating and difficult to understand since it was basically like learning a new language; computer language.🥲 However, now when I am looking back at it, I would want to do it again because it is the most simple compared to the rest of our labs.🤣🤣

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite because I love math 🔢. Math is my favorite subject to study in school. In this lab, we found averages of a group of numbers inputed by the user. This was an interesting lab to do because it was like building a mini average calculator. ➕➖➗✖️

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is also a top 3 lab because it was the first time we coded for a graphic 🎨. All of the other labs were written for a word output. However, this lab resulted in a fun color changing animation so it was kind of like a breath of fresh air. It was visually pretty and fun to look at the results we coded 🤩
